3. **Edit Existing Transaction (PUT):**  
   Updates transaction data by editing and sending updated values to the API.

4. **Delete Transaction (DELETE):**  
   Deletes a specific transaction from both the API and the page by clicking the `Delete` button.

5. **Dynamic UI Updates:**  
   Automatically refreshes the displayed data after performing any operation.
